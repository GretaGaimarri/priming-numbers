# Scalar Adjective Priming Task

This project involves a priming task where the primes are scalar adjectives and the targets are symbolic or non-symbolic quantities. The objective is to investigate the potential relationship between these words and the generalized quantity mechanism.

## Description

The Scalar Adjective Priming Task is designed to explore how scalar adjectives (e.g., good, bad, tall, short) can influence the perception and processing of numerical targets. The idea is to reproduce a similar subliminal priming task with scalar adjectives, to test the possible involvement of the Generalized Magnitude System (Walsh, 2003; Kochari et al., 2022).
The experiment is composed of a prime (adjective) and target. Adjectives are divided into “less quantity-related” (0) and “more quantity-related” (1). Two versions: numerical priming and dots. in the numerical priming task, targets are numbers from 1 to 9 (except 5). Participants are asked to say whether the target number is smaller or bigger than 5. Two conditions: Congruent and Incongruent. In the congruent condition: low-magnitude adjectives are followed by a number smaller than 5 and high-magnitude by a number bigger than 5. Vice versa in the incongruent condition. 
The second version of this task is similar to Lourenco et al. (2016):
