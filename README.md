# Scalar Adjective Priming Task

This project involves a priming task where the primes are scalar adjectives and the targets are numbers. The objective is to investigate the potential relationship between these words and the generalized quantity mechanism.

## Description

The Scalar Adjective Priming Task is designed to explore how scalar adjectives (e.g., good, bad, tall, short) can influence the perception and processing of numerical targets.
