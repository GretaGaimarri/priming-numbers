# Scalar Adjective Priming Task

This project involves a priming task where the primes are scalar adjectives and the targets are numbers. The objective is to investigate the potential relationship between these words and the generalized quantity mechanism.

## Description

The Scalar Adjective Priming Task is designed to explore how scalar adjectives (e.g., small, large) can influence the perception and processing of numerical targets. This project aims to investigate the cognitive mechanisms underlying this relationship between these words and quantity, specifically focusing on the Generalized Quantity Mechanism.
