# Scalar Adjective Priming Task

This project involves a priming task where the primes are scalar adjectives and the targets are symbolic or non-symbolic quantities. The objective is to investigate the potential relationship between these words and the generalized quantity mechanism.

## Description

The Scalar Adjective Priming Task is designed to explore how scalar adjectives (e.g., good, bad, tall, short) can influence the perception and processing of quanitity targets. The idea is to reproduce a similar subliminal priming task with scalar adjectives, to test the possible involvement of the Generalized Magnitude System (Walsh, 2003; Kochari et al., 2022).
The experiment is composed of a prime (adjective) followed by a target. Adjectives are divided into “less quantity-related” (0) and “more quantity-related” (1). Two versions of the experiment: numerical priming and dots. In the numerical priming task, targets are numbers from 1 to 9 (except 5). Participants are asked to say whether the target number is smaller or bigger than 5. Two conditions: Congruent and Incongruent. In the congruent condition: low-magnitude adjectives are followed by a number smaller than 5 and high-magnitude by a number bigger than 5. Vice versa in the incongruent condition. 
The second version of this task is similar to Lourenco et al. (2016): the experiment involves presenting participants with pairs of adjectives (a low- and a high-magnitude adjective, these are displayed in different colors: one in black, one in white) followed by a display of two groups of dots (black and white). Participants are asked to estimate which group of dots is more numerous.The purpose of these adjectives is to serve as primes, which may influence participants' perceptions or responses in the subsequent dot estimation task. The congruence or incongruence between the prime's color and the dominant dot color might reveal how alignment between expectation (set by the prime) and reality (dot counts) affects response accuracy and reaction times.
